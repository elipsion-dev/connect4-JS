Connect 4 Game - HTML, CSS, JS

Connect 4 game written in HTML, CSS, & JS. I wrote this in preparation for my final project for the coding bootcamp I went through (The Last Mile). My final project was to create a full MERN project out of a connect 4 game. I wanted users to be able to save their game state to the database and return later and load their saved games. I wanted to line out the look, feel, and logic of the actual game before jumping into the MERN project - that is what this project was about.
